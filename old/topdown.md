Here's an alarming truth about myself: I've become addicted to "Top-Down" learning.

Now, when writing this blog post, I did some digging into the terms "Top-Down" and "Bottom-Up" in the context of learning. There are many results; not many of which use the terms with the same definition as me. And so, I will first define what I mean by "Top-Down" learning.

Let's assume that for your calculus class, your professor assigns 5 problems to be completed by the end of the week.

The opposite of top-down learning is "bottom-up" learning.



## Dynamic Programming

For those of you familiar with dynamic programming, it might be easier to understand if we draw parallels to top-down vs. bottom up dynamic programming algorithms.

A top down dynamic programming approach begins with the target state - the "goal" in mind. From the goal, we determine what states we must solve

## A Graphical Perspective

People often use terms like "depth" and "breadth" to describe knowledge. For example, at UWaterloo we have depth and breadth course requirements; and the implication is intuitive. Depth in knowledge refers to understanding a topic thoroughly, and breadth in knowledge refers to understanding a wide range of topics in a field.

We can think of learning as follows:

## Tendencies

Top-down learning is incredibly effective in accomplishing goals in the short term. Courses have assignments, which require knowledge to complete - often knowledge that I don't have yet. 


## Knowledge Erosion

As I'm sure we all know, knowledge fades over time. As a 3rd year CS student, I am no longer proficient in high school chemistry
